# rocks_pygame
a fun little game made in Python

'rocks'
programmed by Bennett Wenger
2016

a modification of 'astrocrash'

Originally a homework project in my Python programming class,
I've decided to clean this up a little.
I'm uploading this as an example of what I can do in Python.

2023 update
I'd like to get this released as a usable game, using the latest Python and SuperWires.
My original PNG and audio files have been lost, and the Pygame website is down.
So I've got some work to do.

First official release is up!
Download the ZIP to find the EXE,
or run it directly in Python (see testing notes below).

Testing notes:
Windows 11
Python 3.11.1
Pygame 2.1.3.dev8
SuperWires 0.9.6
